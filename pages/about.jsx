            ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&apos;m RÃ©mi Henry â€” a passionate Software Engineer and
            UI/UX Designer with a Master&apos;s in Information Technology from
            EPITECH and international experience from California State
            University, Long Beach.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for
            design, I specialize in building modern, user-focused web
            applications. Over the past few years, I&apos;ve worked with
            companies like Picsellia, Nema Studio, and Bleemeo, where I
            contributed to projects involving cutting-edge technologies like
            React, VueJS, Svelte, and WebAssembly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond code, I care deeply about the user experience, efficient
            product workflows, and bridging the gap between technical execution
            and intuitive design. I'm equally comfortable writing clean
            JavaScript as I am designing in Figma, and I thrive in
            collaborative, agile environments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently open to new opportunities, particularly in roles that
            combine tech, product thinking, and design â€” including VIE positions
            abroad.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let&apos;s build something meaningful together.
