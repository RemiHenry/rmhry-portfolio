            üëã Hi, I&apos;m R√©mi Henry ‚Äî a passionate Software Engineer and
            UI/UX Designer with a Master&apos;s in Information Technology from
            EPITECH and international experience from California State
            University, Long Beach.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a strong foundation in front-end development and a keen eye for
            design, I specialize in building modern, user-focused web
            applications. Over the past few years, I&apos;ve worked with
            companies like Picsellia, Nema Studio, and Bleemeo, where I
            contributed to projects involving cutting-edge technologies like
            React, VueJS, Svelte, and WebAssembly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond code, I care deeply about the user experience, efficient
            product workflows, and bridging the gap between technical execution
            and intuitive design. I&apos;m equally comfortable writing clean
            JavaScript as I am designing in Figma, and I thrive in
            collaborative, agile environments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently open to new opportunities, particularly in roles that
            combine tech, product thinking, and design ‚Äî including VIE positions
            abroad.
            <br />
            <br />
            Let&apos;s build something meaningful together.

            üìç Picsellia ‚Äì Software Engineer (Jun 2023 ‚Äì Present)
            <br />
            At Picsellia, I contributed to the development and maintenance of a
            comprehensive AI lifecycle management platform. I played a key role
            in implementing an internal UI kit, modernizing the front-end, and
            streamlining design consistency across the application. I also
            suggested and integrated new technologies that improved our
            development workflows and deployment efficiency.

            üìç Listn ‚Äì Front-End Developer Intern (Apr 2022 ‚Äì Jul 2022)
            <br />
            During my internship at Listn, I enhanced the web app&apos;s design
            and overall user experience by redesigning key UI elements. I also
            participated in the open beta deployment, helping deliver a stable
            and engaging product for early adopters. This experience sharpened
            my skills in user feedback integration and iterative development.

            üìç Bleemeo ‚Äì Mobile Developer Intern (Oct 2021 ‚Äì Feb 2022)
            <br />
            At Bleemeo, I focused on finalizing and deploying the mobile app to
            the iOS store. I improved the user interface and optimized the
            mobile UX, aligning the application with Apple&apos;s guidelines and
            enhancing usability for system monitoring on the go.

            üìç EPITECH ‚Äì Hub Coordinator (Sep 2021 ‚Äì Mar 2022)
            <br />
            As Hub Coordinator, I managed student projects and ensured the
            smooth running of educational activities. I supervised peer learning
            sessions, validated projects, and supported fellow students,
            building leadership and organizational skills that complement my
            technical background.

            üìç Bleemeo ‚Äì Front-End Developer Intern (Jul 2020 ‚Äì Dec 2020)
            <br />
            In this earlier internship at Bleemeo, I contributed to improving
            the web app&apos;s interface and developed reusable React components
            to support new features. This role helped deepen my knowledge of
            scalable component architecture and sharpened my UI/UX sensibility.

            üìç Nema Studio ‚Äì End-of-Studies Project
            <br />
            Nema Studio was a 3-year collaborative end-of-studies project
            developed by a team of six students, including myself, with the
            ambitious goal of creating a next-generation Digital Audio
            Workstation (DAW). Our vision was to design a tool that would bring
            live collaboration to music production‚Äîa &quot;Figma for
            audio&quot;‚Äîallowing multiple users to compose, edit, and mix music
            together in real time via the browser.
            <br />
            I led the UI/UX design efforts, producing detailed mockups and
            interaction flows using Figma to ensure a smooth, creative user
            experience. On the technical side, I developed the front-end
            interface using Svelte, integrating it with a high-performance audio
            engine written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for browser
            compatibility. The project pushed us to explore innovative solutions
            at the intersection of design, web performance, and real-time
            collaboration.
            <br />
            Nema Studio was awarded Best Project on our EPITECH Toulouse campus
            (out of 6 projects) and later earned the title of Best Project at
            the national level among 17 EPITECH campuses across France. This
            recognition marked a highlight of my academic path and underscored
            the impact of our work both technically and creatively.

            üìç L&apos;aller Simple ‚Äì Website Design & Development Project
            <br />
            For this personal project, I designed, developed, and deployed a
            complete website for L&apos;aller Simple, a rural holiday cottage. I
            began by creating user-focused mockups in Figma to reflect the cozy,
            inviting atmosphere of the cottage. I then implemented the front-end
            using responsive web technologies, ensuring a smooth experience
            across all devices. The site includes a reservation feature,
            enabling visitors to book their stays directly online, and also acts
            as a landing page to showcase the property&apos;s key features and
            visual identity. This project demonstrated my ability to manage an
            end-to-end web solution‚Äîfrom design to deployment‚Äîwhile balancing
            functionality and aesthetic appeal.
